      </H1>
      Ficl is a complete programming language interpreter designed to be embedded into other systems (including firmware based ones) as a command, macro, and development prototype language. Unlike other scripting interpreters,
      Ficl: 
      <UL>
        <LI>
          typically takes under 2 hours to port to a new system -- much less if the target operating system is one of several already supported (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, RiscOS, and more)
        </LI>
        <LI>
          has a small memory footprint: a fully featured Win32 console version takes less than 100K of memory, and a minimal version is less than half that
        </LI>
        <LI>
          is relatively quick thanks to its threaded code virtual machine design and just in time compiling
        </LI>
        <LI>
          is a complete and powerful programming language
        </LI>
        <LI>
          is interactive
        </LI>
        <LI>
          has object oriented programming features that can be used to wrap data structures or classes of the host system without altering them - even if the host is mainly written in a non-OO
          language
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <P>
        Ficl syntax is based on ANS Forth and the code is Standard C. See below for examples of <A href="#includesficl">software and products that include ficl</A>. Ficl stands for "Forth inspired
        command language".&nbsp;

      <H3>
        Ficl vs. other Forth interpreters
      </H3>
      Where Forths usually view themselves as the center of the system and expect the rest of the system to be coded in Forth, Ficl acts as a component of the system. It is easy to export code
      written in C or ASM to Ficl in the style of TCL, or to invoke Ficl code from a compiled module. This allows you to do incremental development in a way that combines the best features of
      threaded languages (rapid development, quick code/test/debug cycle, reasonably fast) with the best features of C (everyone knows it, easier to support large blocks of code, efficient, type
      checking). In addition, Ficl provides a simple and powerful object model that can act as an object oriented <I>adapter</I> for code written in C (or asm, Forth, C++...).&nbsp;

          Simple to integrate into existing systems: the sample implementation requires three Ficl function calls (see the example program in testmain.c).
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Written in ANSI C for portability.&nbsp;
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Standard: Implements the ANS Forth CORE word set, part of the CORE EXT word set, SEARCH and SEARCH EXT, TOOLS and part of TOOLS EXT, LOCAL and LOCAL EXT, EXCEPTION, MEMORY,&nbsp; and
          various extras.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Extensible: you can export code written in Forth, C, or asm in a straightforward way. Ficl provides open facilities for extending the language in an application specific way. You can even
          add new control structures (not surprising if you're familiar with Forth)
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Ficl and C/C++ can interact in two ways: Ficl can wrap C code, and C functions can invoke ficl code.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Ficl code is thread safe and re-entrant:&nbsp; All Ficl Virtual Machines share one system dictionary (version 3.0 will permit multiple dictionaries); each Ficl Virtual Machine has an
          otherwise complete state, and each can be bound to a separate I/O channel (or none at all). An optional function called ficlLockDictionary() can control exclusive dictionary access. This
          function is stubbed out by default (See FICL_MULTITHREAD in sysdep.h). As long as there is only one "session" that can compile words into the dictionary, you do not need exclusive
          dictionary access for multithreading. <B>Note</B>: while the code is re-entrant, there are still restrictions on how you can use it safely in a multithreaded system. Specifically, the VM
          itself maintains state, so you generally need a VM per thread in a multithreaded system. If interrupt service routines make calls into Ficl code that alters VM state, then these generally
          need their own VM as well. Alternatively, you could provide a mutual exclusion mechanism to serialize access to a VM from multiple threads.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          ROMable: Ficl is designed to work in RAM based and ROM code / RAM data environments. It does require somewhat more memory than a pure ROM implementation because it builds its system
          dictionary in RAM at startup time.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Written in ANSI C to be as simple as I can make it to understand, support, debug, and port. Compiles without complaint at /Az /W4 (require ANSI C, max. warnings) under Microsoft VC++. Ports
          to several other toolchains and operating systems (notably FreeBSD and Linux flavors) exist.
        </LI>
        <LI>
          Does full 32 bit math (but you need to implement two mixed precision math primitives (see sysdep.c))
        </LI>
      </UL>
      <HR>
      <H2>
        <A name="porting"></A>Porting ficl
      </H2>
      To install ficl on your target system, you need an ANSI C compiler and its runtime library. Inspect the system dependent macros and functions in <TT>sysdep.h</TT> and <TT>sysdep.c</TT> and edit
      them to suit your system. For example, <TT>INT16</TT> is a <TT>short</TT> on some compilers and an <TT>int</TT> on others. Check the default <TT>CELL</TT> alignment controlled by <TT>
      FICL_ALIGN</TT>. If necessary, add new definitions of <TT>ficlMalloc, ficlFree, ficlRealloc</TT>, and <TT>ficlTextOut</TT> to work with your operating system. Finally, use <TT>testmain.c</TT>
      as a guide to installing the ficl system and one or more virtual machines into your code. You do not need to include <TT>testmain.c</TT> in your build.&nbsp; 
      <P>
        Note: ficlLockDictionary can be left unimplemented in most multithreaded implementations - it's only necessary if you expect to have more than one thread modifying the dictionary at the same
        time. If you do decide to implement it, make sure calls to ficlLockDictionary can nest properly (see the comments in sysdep.h). You need to keep count of nested locks and unlocks and do the
        right thing.
      </P>
      <P>
        Feel free to stub out the double precision math functions (which are presently implemented as inline assembly because it's so easy on many 32 bit processors) with kludge code that only goes
        to 32 bit precision. In most applications, you won't notice the difference. If you're doing a lot of number crunching, consider implementing them correctly.&nbsp;
      </P>
      <H3>
        Build controls
      </H3>
      The file sysdep.h contains default values for build controls. Most of these are written such that if you define them on the compiler command line, the defaults are overridden. I suggest you
      take the defaults on everything below the "build controls" section until you're confident of your port. Beware of declaring too small a dictionary, for example. You need about 3200 cells for a
      full system, about 2000 if you strip out most of the "soft" words.&nbsp; 
      <H3>
        Soft Words
      </H3>
      Many words from all the supported wordsets are written in Forth, and stored as a big string that Ficl compiles when it starts. The sources for all of these words are in directory
      ficl/softwords. There is a .bat file (softcore.bat) and a PERL 5 script (softcore.pl) that convert Forth files into the file softcore.c, so softcore.c is really dependent on the Forth sources.
      This is not reflected in the Visual C++ project database. For the time being, it's a manual step. You can edit softcore.bat to change the list of files that contribute to softcore.c.&nbsp;

      <DL>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_SYSTEM *ficlInitSystem(int nDictCells)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Initializes Ficl's shared system data structures, and creates the dictionary allocating the specified number of CELLs from the heap (by a call to ficlMalloc)
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlTermSystem(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Reclaims memory allocated for the ficl system including all dictionaries and all virtual machines created by vmCreate. Any uses of the memory allocation words (allocate and resize) are your
          problem.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>int ficlBuild(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, FICL_CODE code, char flags)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Create a primitive word in ficl's main dictionary with the given name, code pointer, and properties (immediate, compile only, etc) as described by the flags (see ficl.h for flag
          descriptions of the form FW_XXXX)
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>int ficlExec(FICL_VM *pVM, char *text)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Feed the specified C string ('\0' terminated) to the given virtual machine for evaluation. Returns various exception codes (VM_XXXX in ficl.h) to indicate the reason for returning. Normal
          exit condition is VM_OUTOFTEXT, indicating that the VM consumed the string successfully and is back for more. ficlExec calls can be nested, and the function itself is re-entrant, but note
          that a VM is static, so you have to take reasonable precautions (for example, use one VM per thread in a multithreaded system if you want multiple threads to be able to execute commands).
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>int ficlExecC(FICL_VM *pVM, char *text, int nChars)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Same as ficlExec, but takes a count indicating the length of the supplied string. Setting nChars to -1 is equivalent to ficlExec (expects '\0' termination).
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>int ficlExecXT(FICL_VM *pVM, FICL_WORD *pFW)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Same as ficlExec, but takes a pointer to a FICL_WORD instead of a string. Executes the word and returns after it has finished. If executing the word results in an exception, this function
          will re-throw the same code if it is nested under another ficlExec family function, or return the exception code directly if not. This function is useful if you need to execute the same
          word repeatedly - you save the dictionary search and outer interpreter overhead.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlFreeVM(FICL_VM *pVM)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Removes the VM in question from the system VM list and deletes the&nbsp; memory allocated to it. This is an optional call, since ficlTermSystem will do this cleanup for you. This function
          is handy if you're going to do a lot of dynamic creation of VMs.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_VM *ficlNewVM(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Create, initialize, and return a VM from the heap using ficlMalloc. Links the VM into the system VM list for later reclamation by ficlTermSystem.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_WORD *ficlLookup(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Returns the address (also known as an XT in this case) of the specified word in the main dictionary. If not found, returns NULL. The address can be used in a call to ficlExecXT.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_DICT *ficlGetDict(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Returns a pointer to the main system dictionary, or NULL if the system is uninitialized.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_DICT *ficlGetEnv(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Returns a pointer to the environment dictionary. This dictionary stores information that describes this implementation as required by the Standard.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlSetEnv(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, UNS32 value)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Enters a new constant into the environment dictionary, with the specified name and value.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlSetEnvD(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys, char *name, UNS32 hi, UNS32 lo)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Enters a new double-cell constant into the environment dictionary with the specified name and value.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>FICL_DICT *ficlGetLoc(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Returns a pointer to the locals dictionary. This function is defined only if FICL_WANT_LOCALS is #defined as non-zero (see sysdep.h). The locals dictionary is the symbol table for <A href= 
          "ficl_loc.html">local variables</A>.
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlCompileCore(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>
        </DT>
        <DD>
          Defined in words.c, this function builds ficl's primitives.&nbsp;
        </DD>
        <DT>
          <B>void ficlCompileSoftCore(FICL_SYSTEM *pSys)</B>

          Defined in softcore.c, this function builds ANS required words and ficl extras by evaluating a text string (think of it as a memory mapped file ;-) ). The string itself is built from files
          in the softwords directory by PERL script softcore.pl.&nbsp;

      You can precede a number with "0x", as in C, and it will be interpreted as a hex value regardless of the value of <CODE>BASE</CODE>. Likewise, numbers prefixed with "0d" will be interpreted as
      decimal values. Example:

      Note: ficl2.05 and later - this behavior is controlled by the <A href="ficl_parse.html">prefix parser</A> defined in <CODE>prefix.c</CODE>. You can add other prefixes by defining handlers for

      <P>
        Ficl implements many of the search order words in terms of two primitives called <CODE><A href="#tosearch">&gt;SEARCH</A></CODE> and <CODE><A href="#searchfrom">SEARCH&gt;</A></CODE>. As
        their names suggest (assuming you're familiar with Forth), they push and pop the search order stack.
      </P>
      <P>
        The standard does not appear to specify any conditions under which the search order is reset to a sane state. Ficl resets the search order to its default state whenever <TT>ABORT</TT>
        happens. This includes stack underflows and overflows. <TT>QUIT</TT> does not affect the search order. The minimum search order (set by <TT>ONLY</TT>) is equivalent to
      </P>
<PRE>
FORTH-WORDLIST 1 SET-ORDER
</PRE>
      <P>
        There is a default maximum of 16 wordlists in the search order. This can be changed by redefining FICL_DEFAULT_VOCS (declared in sysdep.h).
      </P>
      <P>
        <B>Note</B>: Ficl resets the search order whenever it does <TT>ABORT</TT>. If you don't like this behavior, just comment out the dictResetSearchOrder() lines in ficlExec().

          Creates a wordlist with the specified number of hash table bins, and leaves the address of the wordlist on the stack. A <TT>ficl-wordlist</TT> behaves exactly as a regular wordlist, but it
          may search faster depending on the number of bins chosen and the number of words it contains at search time. As implemented in ficl, a wordlist is single threaded by default. <TT>
          ficl-named-wordlist</TT> takes a name for the wordlist and creates a word that pushes the <TT>wid</TT>. This is by contrast to <TT>VOCABULARY</TT>, which also has a name, but replaces the

          Ficl wordlists (2.05 and later) have a name property that can be assigned. This is used by <TT>ORDER</TT> to list the names of wordlists in the search order. The name is assumed to be a \0

        <DD>
          Ficl wordlists have a parent wordlist pointer that is not specified in standard Forth. Ficl initializes this pointer to NULL whenever it creates a wordlist, so it ordinarily has no effect.
          This word sets the parent pointer to the wordlist specified on the top of the stack. Ficl's implementation of <TT>SEARCH-WORDLIST</TT> will chain backward through the parent link of the
          wordlist when searching. This simplifies Ficl's object model in that the search order does not need to reflect an object's class hierarchy when searching for a method. It is possible to
          implement Ficl object syntax in strict ANS Forth, but method finders need to manipulate the search order explicitly.

          Create a user variable with the given name. User variables are virtual machine local. Each VM allocates a fixed amount of storage for them. You can change the maximum number of user
